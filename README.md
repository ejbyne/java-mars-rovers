# Mars Rovers (Java)

## Summary

Having previously built a [Ruby version](https://github.com/ejbyne/ruby-mars-rovers.git) of Mars Rovers, I decided to try recreating it in Java to gain more practice with Java OOP and TDD.

## Technologies used

- Java
- JUnit
- Mockito
- Gradle

## Instructions

This assumes that you have [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) installed on your machine for automated test running.

Clone the repo on your machine:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ejbyne/java-mars-rovers.git
```

Change into the cloned directory and run the tests:
```
$ cd java-mars-rovers
$ gradle test
```

## To do list

- Put the application on a Java server with a web browser interface
